# Etch-A-Sketch

Written in HTML/Java/CSS in order to help with learning the languages.

Learned:
 - how to make css grid rows and columns dynamic
 - how to use event listeners more effectively
 - how to write javascript that interacts with html/css

Next steps?
 - Color changer
 - smaller borders somehow? this would be to allow for more boxes
